# LinkedIn Invite Opener

This little chrome extension (that is in alpha really) helps people open LinkedIn friend invites more quickly. It opens at most 10 tabs for all outstanding connections at once, making it easy to reply to big batches of invites. 

## Disclaimer

I know all the chrome extension settings aren't configured right, but I'm just being lazy (check the code yourself!)

## Installing

Drag and drop the crx file in chrome://extensions. Or build the extension yourself!
